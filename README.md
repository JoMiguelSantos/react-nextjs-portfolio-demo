# React/NextJS Portfolio Demo

This is a portfolio Demo to display a combination of varied FrontEnd frameworks working together to create a Single Page Application using React and NextJS as main pillars.

This is NOT intended to be a final product with all content and functionality necessary to be used by final customers.

The idea for this demo is to showcase a fully operational CRUD Single Page Application using React and NextJS to harness the power of Server Side Rendering and code splitting optimization.

This Web App uses MongoDB as database, provided by MongoDB Atlas and makes use of the NextJS internal server to handle all requests and also features Authentication provided by Auth0.

State management is done using Redux and CSS styles are performed using SASS. This App is deployed using NOW.

Even though the App is responsive to the different screen sizes, this App is not optimized for Mobile so bear that in mind if the experience is sub par.

I do not allow anyone to use significant portions of this codebase and claim it as their own work. 
Of course, if you'd like to use the configs and functions to help with your own project, feel free to reach out.
